# Boutique Candle Company - DB Final Project

## Team Name: Project Tsukuyomi

## Team Members:
* Saad Mahmood
* Saadh Ahmed
* Abdullah Shehata

## Description

This is a repo for our final project. It contains a mock database set up for a boutique candle company.

### Dependencies

* MariaDB or MySQL
* HeidiSQL

### Files

* DBProject.sql - This is the main file that contains the DLL commands and the INSERT commands to input our mock data. We decided to combine the DLL commands and the generated data into a single SQL file for the sake of simplicity. Running this .sql file will create the necessary tables and populate them with all our data.
* unique.sql - This file contains our 5 interesting SQL queries
* ER diagram.pdf - This is the PDF of our ER Diagram

### Instructions on running the project

* After extracting on your device, open a session on HeidiSQL (or you preferred admin tool) with network type MariaDB or MySQL.
* Click on "file" in the upper right corner and select "Load SQL file".
* Select DBProject.sql from your file manager. This will open the SQL file for you.
* On the top bar select the run icon. Make sure it is set to "send queries one by one".
* After running, you should be able to see a database named "DBProject" in the left panel. Clicking the dropdown will show all the created tables. These will already be populated with the data.
* You can open unique.sql in a separate text editor, and copy and paste each individual query to the bottom of the DBProject.sql. Highlighting that added line and right clicking will allow you to run each indidivual query.
